# duke-registration-enhancer

Chrome extension that enhances Dukehub's registration page by changing the page's appearance and adding features.

## Disclaimers

- This is a temporary extension. Eventually, the entire Duke registration site will be overhauled, be it in 6 months or 6 years. When that happens, the entire extension will be obsolete and need to be disabled or completely changed.

- This may unintentionally break functionality. There could be certain not well known features of the registration page that only a few students use. I cannot test every single button, so there is an unlikely possibility things may break.

- This may intentionally break functionality. There might be buttons I believe absolutely no one uses, so I will remove or change them. HOWEVER, if you actually miss them, please don't hesitate to contact me.
