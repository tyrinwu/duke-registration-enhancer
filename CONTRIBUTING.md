# Contributing

Fork, clone, create a new branch, add your changes, and submit a pull request. 

For adding a new feature, please create an option so users can toggle it on/off. To do this, make sure to modify `options.html`, `js/options.js` and `main.js`. Also, create a new Javascript file and add it to `manifest.json` to keep things neat.

Please follow naming conventions in this project to keep things neat, e.g. using camelcase for javascript files.
