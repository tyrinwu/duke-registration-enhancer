# Contributing

Fork, clone, create a new branch, add your changes, and submit a pull request. 

When adding a new feature, please make it so users can toggle it on/off. To do this, go into `main.js` and add your feature. Then, simply use `options[yourOptionHere].value` to enable or disable your feature.

Please follow naming conventions in this project to keep things neat, e.g. using camelcase for javascript files.
